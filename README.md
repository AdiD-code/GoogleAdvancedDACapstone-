# Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone â€“ Employee Attrition Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the capstone project completed as part of the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-advanced-data-analytics-capstone). The project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data for a fictional company, Salifort Motors, to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and to develop predictive models for attrition.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **Others:** Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description

### Business Objective

Salifort Motors aims to reduce employee turnover by understanding the factors leading to attrition. The HR department has collected data on various employee attributes, and the goal is to analyze this data to provide actionable insights.

### Dataset

The dataset includes information on employees with features such as:

Satisfaction Level, Hours worked monthly, Number of projects, Last evaluation, etc.

### Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized distributions and relationships between variables.
   - Identified trends and patterns related to attrition.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Used correlation analysis and feature importance scores to select relevant features.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to present findings to stakeholders.

### Key Findings

- Employees with low job satisfaction and high overtime are more likely to leave.
- Certain departments have higher attrition rates.
- Younger employees with fewer years at the company are more prone to attrition.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy:** 88%
- **Precision:** 85%
- **Recall:** 82%
- **F1-Score:** 83%

The Random Forest model provided the best performance in predicting employee attrition, allowing the HR department to proactively address potential turnover.
